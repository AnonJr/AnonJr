# Who am I?

That's a question I ask myself every day&hellip;

I've been a programmer, an educator, a coach (youth soccer, High School swimming), a Life Guard Instructor, a photographer/roadie/studio tech for a local band; I've done some factory work, game streaming, and now I'm working in stringed instrument building/repair.

## Games, Streaming, and other Videos

I still live stream Minecraft from the [CoffeeCraft](https://www.coffeecraft.us/) server, and post those videos to YouTube and Archive.org. Likewise for some "Let's Play" style playthroughs of older games in my *Games Revisited* series.

I've also been live streaming the early stages of my new profession - building and repairing stringed instruments. Videos should be making there way up before too long.

## Programming

I spent college and afterwards as something of an IT [Renaissance Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath#Renaissance_ideal:_the_Renaissance_man), with a diverse skill set and a love of learning. My old job dealt with web programming and all things online learning (and some IRL classes).

I used to answer questions over on Stack Exchange, I may return to distributing articles to my Dev.to profile, but I will definitely keep making resource and data packs for Minecraft and publishing them on Planet Minecraft.

## Podcasts

Bible By Example is a podcast dedicated to covering Scripture in a way that enables discussion between believers and non-believers. This is not a preachy service, but a walk through what really is and isn't in the scripture so we can have a constructive debate and not get distracted by arguing over things that aren't really there in the first place.

The gospel of Jesus Christ is presented calmly, sanely, logically, to the average man, who is a man of sane, logical, common sense.
